          <h1>G‑Bonk Whitepaper</h1>
          <p><em>Version 1.0 – August 2025</em></p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            G‑Bonk is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain that aims to
            combine fun community engagement with serious utility.  Memecoins
            have captured the imagination of the cryptosphere, but many lack
            long‑term plans.  G‑Bonk differentiates itself by coupling a lively
            mascot and viral appeal with a clear roadmap and real‑world
            applications.
          </p>

          <h2>Vision &amp; Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our vision is to create a vibrant ecosystem where holders are
            rewarded not only through speculative price appreciation but also
            through concrete utility.  We will foster an inclusive community,
            provide innovative financial products and empower users to be part
            of a playful yet purposeful crypto project.
          </p>

          <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
          <p>
            G‑Bonk uses the SPL Token standard on Solana with six decimal
            places.  The initial supply of <strong>865,958,249.418944 G‑BONK</strong>
            tokens is fixed; no future minting is possible.  The token’s
            authority and creator are the same account
            (<code>RtrdM3...aW7Koi</code>).  At the time of writing, there are
            approximately <strong>360 token holders</strong>【165187846141089†screenshot】.
          </p>
          <p>
            Distribution is community‑driven: 50% of the supply was distributed
            through an airdrop to early supporters, 25% is reserved for
            development and marketing, 15% for liquidity provision on DEX
            platforms and 10% for strategic partnerships.  Transaction fees are
            minimal on Solana, ensuring inexpensive transfers and swaps.
          </p>

          <h2>Use Cases</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond simple transfers, G‑Bonk will power several products:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Staking:</strong> Holders can stake G‑Bonk to earn
            additional tokens and participate in governance.</li>
            <li><strong>G‑Trade:</strong> An exchange platform launching in
            Q1 2026 that uses fees in G‑Bonk to incentivise liquidity and burn
            part of the supply.</li>
            <li><strong>G‑Bank:</strong> A traditional bank launching in
            Q3 2026 combining fiat and cryptocurrency products to bridge
            decentralised and traditional finance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Roadmap</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Q3 2025 – Token Launch:</strong> Deployment of the
            G‑Bonk token on Solana and initial DEX listings.</li>
            <li><strong>Q4 2025 – Staking:</strong> Introduction of a staking
            program with dynamic rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Q1 2026 – G‑Trade:</strong> Launch of G‑Trade, an
            exchange platform that uses fees in G‑Bonk.</li>
            <li><strong>Q3 2026 – G‑Bank:</strong> Launch of G‑Bank, a
            traditional bank with a combination of fiat money and
            cryptocurrency.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Security &amp; Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            The G‑Bonk contract is immutable: mint and freeze authorities are
            renounced to prevent further supply changes.  We encourage users to
            verify the contract on Solscan and use reputable wallets.  As
            regulatory frameworks evolve, the project will adhere to applicable
            jurisdictions and best practices for transparency.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            G‑Bonk is more than a meme.  It combines the joy of community
            participation with a realistic roadmap and utility.  By joining
            forces, our holders will help shape the future of decentralised
            finance and entertainment on Solana.
